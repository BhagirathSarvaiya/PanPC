approach is, in the CA tradition, governed by situated analysis and members' response, thus involves interpretation. Part of her categorisation (i.e. a) and b) above) is largely independent
of members' response and gives scope for objective coding. The project for which the data were collected is interested in the tension between interruptive phenomena as identified by
operational criteria and responses to interruptive acts (see Guillot 2005). When King Taejong stepped down from the throne, his first-born son officially became the new king. The
first-born son, however, recognized that he lacked the requisite skills for rulership, and felt that Sejong was destined to become king. He and his brother, the second prince, believing it
was their duty to place Sejong on the throne, behaved with extreme rudeness in the court and were soon banished from Seoul. Shared vocabulary alone does not show a relationship,
as it may be loaned from one language to another or through the language of a third party. cognate There are shared words between, for example, Turkic and Ugric languages, because
borrowing has occurred. However, it has been difficult to find proto-Ural-Altaic words across both language families. Such words would be found in all branches of the Uralic and Altaic
trees and should follow regular sound changes from the proto language to known modern languages. Buck (, - , ) was the first woman to win the , with her . June 26 1892 March 6 1973

Among those who view Altaic as valid, some believe it is related to Uralic, but does not form a taxon with it, the two being related at a higher level only, such as the proposed Eurasiatic
family. Although the Ural-Altaic family was formerly widely accepted, today it has almost no adherents. This does not mean, however, that a genetic relationship between Uralic and
Altaic is generally rejected; rather, this is a subject on which linguists disagree. From this, scholars have plausibly argued that Proto-Indo-European existed as a living language some
time between 6000 BC and 4000 BC in the plains to the north of the . (As a measure of the difficulty of this task, some argue that the reconstructed vocabulary of Proto-Indo-European,
together with other known information about migrations, indicates a northern landscape, although this area notably lacks flat ground.) Nevertheless, the dialects are not absolutely
identical in orthography; the vocabularies used in the different dialects have diverged. In addition, while literary vocabulary is often shared among all dialects (at least in orthography; the
readings are different), colloquial vocabularies are often different. The complex interaction between Chinese written and spoken language can be illustrated with . The statement captures
the essence of King Sejong's determination and dedication to cultural independence and commitment to the welfare of the people. When first proclaimed by King Sejong, Hunminjeongeum

major concept to keep in mind involves the argument, starting with , that languages do not evolve in a haphazard manner, but rather according to certain rules. Using these rules, one
could theoretically run the evolutionary process backwards and reconstruct the root language. Comparative linguists have done this, producing parts of the hypothetical language, named
Then Let me quote some of noticeable scholars and experts in this field who can back up my explanation. In 2005 at the Seoul Digital Forum, former vice president of the United States,
Al Gore said, "Korea's digital revolution is historically the second gift. Korea gives to the whole world following its invention of the movable metal type printing method." Such
non-overlapped violations of speakers rights are overlooked in qualitatively-driven approaches advocating dealing with overlaps, as observable phenomena, rather than with interruptions,
whose identification is deemed to involve value judgements (e.g. Drummond 1989, Tannen 1994; see references at the end of this section). Interruptions are defined as a function of
utterance incompleteness, judged on the basis of unequivocal breaks in the previous speaker's last uttered word, in the syntax of the previous speaker's utterance and/or in the unit of
meaning developed by the previous speaker. Others, citing the wide acceptance of his classification of (cf. Nichols 1992:5), are taking more of a wait-and-see attitude. Greenberg also has

between two languages is that contact between populations often results in exchange of words, so that similarities in vocabulary do not necessarily indicate a common origin. Chinese
writing has been known in Korea for over 2,000 years. In South Korea, school children are expected to learn about 1,800 Hanja by the end of high school. There are 24 letters in the
